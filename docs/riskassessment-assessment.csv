Notes:,,,,,,,,
Risk - descriptions should be some reasonable approximation of what is written above but does not need to be exact,,,,,,,,
"Reasoning - The reasoning should approximately match to the user's assessment of the likelihood and impact of a potential risk.  If, for instance the likelihood and impact are marked high, the reasoning should reflect why it might be high",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Mitigating Controls - For the purpose of this exercise we did not include mitigating controls,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Total Risk Score - Should not be less than a reasonable approximation of the likelihood x impact.  For instance, if L=High and I=High (and no mitigating control exists) then Risk cannot equal Low",,,,,,,,
